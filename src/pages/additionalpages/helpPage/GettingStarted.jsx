          <strong>5.2 Automated Rent Payment Recording:</strong> A crucial note:
          Rent payments are a special case. They should <strong>not</strong> be
          manually entered. Instead, the system intelligently and automatically
          records rent payments when a tenant is assigned to a property. This
          process is designed to maintain the utmost data accuracy without
          requiring your manual intervention.

          sources and expenses beyond rent payments. This comprehensive approach
          ensures you have a complete financial snapshot of your property
